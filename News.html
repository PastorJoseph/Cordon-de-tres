        <p class="fs-3 mt-5">As the year winds down to a close, it's natural to look back and think about what has passed in what feels like so short a time. The year saw many rapid changes and events, including the Russian Invasion of Ukraine, skyrocketing gas prices in the midst of general inflation, and a feeling among many that the pandemic had passed and we could go back to "life as normal." Of course, the covid-19 continues to mutate and spread, and is still causing a great deal of illness and loss of life. My wife and I both got it this year and it is rare to find anyone who hasn't caught it at least once, and many have dealt with it multiple times. I also know others,  including my mom and my siblings, who have managed to isolate successfully enough to avoid it.
         </p>
        <p class="fs-3 mt-5">We have seen God work in the lives of many of our dear ones, and this ministry has been one of the channels that God has used to pour out His grace and healing upon us. We are very grateful to Him for all he has done and is doing this year, and will continue to do in the days ahead.
         </p>
        <p class="fs-3 mt-5">Grace, peace, and blessings to you all!

          Last day of the year, and we are looking hopefully toward the new one. This truly feels like a time of new beginnings both for us personally and for our church family. The New Year's Eve-Eve party last night was filled with fun and laughter, and we all shared with the group things from 2022 for which we are grateful. And we face the new year with hearts full of  gratitude to God because no matter where he takes us and whatever happens, He is there!

          First month of the year is nearly over and we are seeing some changes to plans we had made. At our first meeting of the year last night we announced the cancellation of this year's love feast due to my wife's upcoming surgery in two weeks. We also will not be meeting as a group for at least a month or two. I tend to be be optomistic in my forecasts and I say we might resume in March. Adela says April. Or May. We shall see. At any rate, please keep us in prayer as we navigate this chapter of our life, as we will surely continue to be praying for you. God's blessings on you all!

          We returned yesterday from a week in the Bay Area. I stayed in San Jose and Adela stayed nearby at Stanford Hospital in Palo Alto. She underwent major surgery to remove a 9cm cyst from her esohagus. She tolerated the surgery remarkably well, earning the admiration of the surgical team. The nursing staff who attended her first week of recovery were amazed at how fast she was recuperating. Of course, we know that this is due to the many who were praying for her before, during, and after the surgery. Now, back home, we are dealing with the difficulties of managing the pain and nursing her back to health. The good news is that our dear ones are walking this with us, and the best news is that Jesus is very near!

          Adela is recovering faster and better than (they) expected. Of course, I'm not surprised; I know my wife. And all the prayer that has been going up on her behalf is bearing fruit. We will be resuming marriage ministry groups in April. All praise and glory to God!

          Since March, we have had a regular gathering and a pool party. The regular gathering was hosted by us in our home, which was the idea of our fellow pastors, out of concern for Adela, who is still recovering from her surgery. The pool party was at the home of Gerald and Becky Perez, who graciously opened their home in spite of the fact that Gerald had recently been in the hospital for a leg injury. We want to thank everyone who has been a part of this community and we are looking forward to the annual love feast which is coming up on June 24th. The theme is "renewing the love in your marriage." There is no cost, and there is always good food, fun and fellowship to be had in these events. <br> Hope to see you there! Until then,

         Saturday night we had our annual love feast, and by all accounts it was a great success. Our dear friends Keith and Candy Jackson were there visiting from Hawaii and we also had many others join us who had never been with us before. We're looking forward to resuming the regular meetings and if the group continues to grow, we might begin to meet one week in Madera or Fresno and the next week in Visalia. Only God knows what he has in store for us all.
